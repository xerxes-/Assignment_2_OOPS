    "Constructors, typically named __init__(), are special methods used for initializing objects when they are created. They are automatically called when a new instance of the class is created.\n",

    "Constructors do not return any value explicitly. They are responsible for initializing the object's state and attributes.\n",

    "# Here's how method abstraction relates to polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction with Abstract Methods:\n",
    "# Method abstraction is achieved using abstract methods, which are defined in abstract base classes (ABCs) using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
    "# Abstract methods do not have implementations in the abstract base class; instead, they specify a method signature that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism with Concrete Implementations:\n",
    "# Concrete subclasses of the abstract base class provide concrete implementations of the abstract methods.\n",
    "# Each subclass can implement the abstract methods differently, allowing for polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "# Polymorphism enables objects of different subclasses to be treated uniformly through a common interface, despite their different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic Binding:\n",
    "# In Python, method calls are dynamically bound at runtime based on the type of the object.\n",
    "# When a method is called on an object, Python determines the appropriate method implementation to execute based on the object's actual type.\n",
    "# This dynamic binding allows for polymorphic behavior, where the same method call can result in different behavior depending on the type of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
    "# Method abstraction and polymorphism provide flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented design.\n",
    "# New subclasses can be added later without modifying existing code, as long as they adhere to the abstract interface defined by the abstract base class.\n",
    "# This promotes code reuse, maintainability, and scalability in large codebases."

    "# Creating Simple Objects:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Building Complex Objects from Simple Ones:\n",
    "# Complex objects are built by composing or combining simpler objects as components.\n",
    "# Instead of inheriting behavior from base classes, complex objects contain references to instances of simpler objects.\n",
    "# The complex object delegates specific tasks or functionalities to its component objects, utilizing their behavior to achieve its own functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Promoting Code Reuse and Modularity:\n",
    "# Composition promotes code reuse by allowing you to reuse existing simple objects as components in multiple complex objects.\n",
    "# It enhances modularity by breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
    "# Composition offers greater flexibility and extensibility compared to inheritance, as it allows objects to be composed dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "# New functionalities can be added or modified by composing different combinations of simple objects, without modifying existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation and Separation of Concerns:\n",
    "# Composition encourages encapsulation and separation of concerns by defining clear boundaries between components.\n",
    "# Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of functionality, reducing the complexity of individual classes and improving code readability and maintainability.\n",

    "# Delegation in composition is a design pattern where an object forwards (or delegates) a task or responsibility to another object, rather than implementing it directly. \n",

    "# In object-oriented programming, \"aggregation\" is a form of composition where one class, referred to as the \"whole\" or \"container,\" \n",
    "# contains another class, referred to as the \"part\" or \"component,\" as a part of its state. \n",
    "# Aggregation represents a \"has-a\" relationship, where the whole object has a reference to the part object but doesn't own the part object's lifecycle. \n",
    "# Unlike simple composition, aggregation implies a weaker relationship, where the part object can exist independently of the whole object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's how aggregation differs from simple composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ownership of Lifecycle:\n",
    "# In simple composition, the whole object owns the lifecycle of the part object. \n",
    "# This means that when the whole object is created or destroyed, the part object is also created or destroyed.\n",
    "# In aggregation, the whole object does not own the lifecycle of the part object. \n",
    "# The part object can exist independently of the whole object. It can be created and destroyed separately from the whole object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Degree of Coupling:\n",
    "# Simple composition typically implies a stronger relationship between the whole and part objects. \n",
    "# The part object is tightly coupled with the whole object, and it often cannot exist without the whole object.\n",
    "# Aggregation implies a weaker relationship between the whole and part objects. \n",
    "# The part object is loosely coupled with the whole object, and it can exist independently or be shared among multiple whole objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiplicity:\n",
    "# In simple composition, there is usually a one-to-one relationship between the whole and part objects. \n",
    "# Each whole object contains exactly one instance of the part object.\n",
    "# In aggregation, there can be a one-to-one or a one-to-many relationship between the whole and part objects. \n",
    "# The whole object can contain multiple instances of the part object, or it can share the same instance with other whole objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semantic Meaning:\n",
    "# Simple composition often implies a stronger semantic meaning, where the part object is an integral part of the whole object's functionality.\n",
    "# Aggregation often implies a weaker semantic meaning, where the part object is a component that can be shared among multiple whole objects or can exist independently."
